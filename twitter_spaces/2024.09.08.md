## Narrative

### Part 1: Reflections on Rest and Emotional Well-being

I just experienced a moment of profound clarity and contentment. After finally getting a full night's sleep - about seven and a half hours - I woke up feeling decent. The day unfolded with various activities, including meeting my recruiter and giving a presentation on using large language models (LLMs) for practical applications.

After enjoying some delicious coffee, I felt tired and decided to take a nap. When I woke up, something extraordinary happened. As I was making coffee, I felt an overwhelming sense of elation. It was a familiar feeling, one I recognized from past experiences when my entire brain seemed to come back online after proper rest.

This state of mind is incredible. Everything feels perfect, and there's no need to push, pull, or change anything. It's a stark contrast to how I often feel, constantly spinning and thrashing about. This tranquil state is a welcome reprieve, and I wonder if I could achieve it more often.

The quality of life difference between how I feel now and my usual state is remarkable. It reminds me of the tweets I've read from Nick, who often writes about happiness and contentment. In this moment, I just want to be alive. I swear I'm only on caffeine, but the feeling is intoxicating.

As I sat down to work on my app, I noticed some interesting emergent behavior that I'm excited to write about and share. It made me feel like maybe there's something substantial to this project after all, that I wasn't just deluding myself.

In this state of mind, I found myself on a dating app, genuinely complimenting people without any expectation of a match or response. It felt incredibly good to channel this overwhelming feeling of love and appreciation into sincere compliments. This experience reminded me of the flirting classes I once took, emphasizing the power of genuine, no-strings-attached compliments.
This is how I want my Sundays to be from now on. It's a state of deep okayness, better than any drug-induced high because there's no rushing feeling or compulsion to do or be anything. I'm just content being here, my mind relatively empty, happy in the present moment.

### Part 2: Insights on Emotions and AI Development

As I was basking in this state of contentment, I had an interesting experience that led to some insights about emotions. I sat down on the couch by the front window, enjoying the beautiful sunlight streaming in. At first, it was pleasant, but then I started to feel warm, which triggered a sense of lethargy. This shift seemed to happen faster than the actual physical sensation of warmth.

Using my app, I noted this feeling, and suddenly realized the connection: yesterday, I was at a friend's place where it was so hot that I felt super lethargic. Today's warmth had subconsciously triggered that same response. This realization was eye-opening - emotions are like programs, bringing previous conditioning into the present moment. They prepare us for stimuli based on past experiences.

This insight made me think about the nature of emotions and how they're essentially programmed, conditioned responses that bake in all our past exposures and experiences. It's a bit unsettling to think of emotions this way, as it takes some of the magic out of the experience. But it's also empowering, as it suggests we can interrupt and change these automatic responses.

Shifting gears to my app development, I'm excited about some emergent behavior I've observed. I've given the AI memory capabilities, and now when I make a passing comment about a person's name, it retrieves relevant information and weaves it into its response as an insight. This might seem small, but it clicked for me that with more scalable ways to store and retrieve information, this could become extremely powerful.

I'm using a simple system right now - a single append-only text file for memory that tails the last 20-30 messages, and a basic JSON key-value store as a poor man's knowledge graph. For each interaction, I tell it the current tags, and it can retrieve any information it wants. This seems to work decently, allowing it to decide how much it needs to know about various aspects of my life for any given turn.

One thing I've realized is that there needs to be more contextual information stored around knowledge. For example, if I send a sad face emoji, it might store "user seems sad," but that might not be relevant hours or days later. There needs to be some kind of temporal information attached to these insights.

My core hypothesis with this app was that if I had a low-friction way to send one-off messages to an LLM throughout my day, I would use it and it would yield insights. And it really does. Even though it's rudimentary right now, it's still proving useful. It's exciting to see that there's really something substantial here, and I'm looking forward to developing it further.


### Part 3: Reflections on Content Creation and Knowledge Sharing

I've been thinking a lot about how to share the things I'm working on in a useful way. This morning, I had a meaningful conversation with my recruiter about LLMs and life plans. Part of me wanted to record it and turn it into a podcast, but I didn't want to make things awkward by asking.

This highlights a fundamental frustration I have: I often have these really meaningful, personal conversations that I believe could be interesting and helpful to others, especially those earlier in their careers. I'd love to find a way to share these insights without compromising the intimacy and authenticity of the conversations.

If I could get paid to do this full-time - just talking to random people about their experiences and perspectives - I'd jump at the chance. Not famous people telling you how things are, but everyday individuals who've done some research and tried to figure out their own answers. These perspectives can be just as helpful as expert opinions, if not more so.

The challenge is finding a way to do this that feels purposeful and impactful, not just one-off conversations. There's a part of me - the utilitarian side - that feels everything has to be for something else. But with this newfound state of contentment, I'm starting to see that it's okay if things just are. If there's more to be done or gained from these conversations, it will emerge naturally.

I've been experimenting with different formats for sharing ideas. Recently, I used voice transcription to ramble for about five minutes, then had Claude (an AI assistant) help me flesh out the ideas. We went back and forth, adding context and refining the concepts. Then I asked Claude to help me structure it into a blog post with an outline and key takeaways. The result was an innovative blog entry where you could read the outline first to decide if you wanted to dive deeper.

But I'm not entirely satisfied with the traditional blog format. The comment section feels limiting - it's just a small box at the bottom that doesn't invite real engagement. I want something more open, where readers can truly engage with the content, speak to the parts they care about, and ignore the rest.

I've been toying with the idea of putting an LLM behind (or in front of) a blog. Instead of just reading an entry, you could chat about it with the AI. You could ask for summaries, dive deeper into specific points, or bring your own context into the conversation. This would allow for much more relevant and personalized engagement.

The AI could then take these conversations and turn them into new blog entries or responses, creating a more dynamic and interconnected knowledge base. It could even provide authors with aggregated feedback and insights from these interactions, offering a new level of reader engagement and understanding.

This approach could revolutionize how we share and engage with content online. It's not just about putting information out there anymore, but about creating an environment conducive to meaningful dialogue and collaborative learning.

### Part 4: Visions for Future Technologies and Personal Growth

I've been envisioning a new kind of workspace, something akin to Figma but for information management and ideation. Imagine being able to paste anything - a YouTube video, a tweet, a string of tweets, screenshots, web pages - into this space. The system would transcribe and summarize the content, allowing you to comment on specific sections, highlight images, or draw on them.

In this workspace, you'd be able to interact with an LLM that has context of all this information. The AI would prioritize your highlights and comments, using various algorithms to determine what's most relevant. You could have multiple conversations with different AI instances, bringing bits and pieces of these conversations back into the main workspace for further commentary and ideation.

The key here is fluid context management. You'd have explicit context - files or information you definitely want the AI to use - and subjective context, where the AI decides what other information might be relevant. You could even have explicit ignores, telling the AI what information to avoid.

This system would be a powerful tool for research and problem-solving. You could create a workspace for any hard problem, refine your ideas, and then share it with others. People could fork your workspace, adding their own layers to it or using it as a data source for their own projects.

I see this as a beautiful way to pass around knowledge and ideas, almost like data bundles that can be built upon and remixed. It frees us up to share and iterate on information in new and interesting ways.

Reflecting on all of this, I realize that my capacity for nuance has grown. I've learned to appreciate that things are often not what they appear to be, and even my most enlightened views are still just approximations of reality. This ability to hold conflicting ideas in my head, to see shades of gray rather than black and white, has made me more open to new perspectives and ideas.

I'm excited about the future of AI and how it can transform the way we interact with information and each other. We're at the cusp of revolutions in countless fields, and while AI might be overhyped in some ways, I believe its impact on how we process and understand information will be profound.

As I wrap up these thoughts, I'm struck by how exhausting yet exhilarating it is to think about all these possibilities. For now, I'll continue working on my little Telegram bot, taking small steps towards these bigger visions. If anyone listens to this and finds it interesting, I'd love to hear your thoughts. If not, well, at least I've gotten these ideas out of my head and into the world. Cheers!


## Prompts

I pasted in the content of the transcript and asked Claude to transform it into a summary, an outline, and a coherent, first-person narrative. Had to steer it a bit to make the outline and summary include the detail I wanted.

```
Can you give me an outline, and a short, 1-paragraph summary?
```

```
You missed a few salient topics—maybe you wrapped them into the first bit, but I'd like you to call all of those out, too
```

```
Can you redo the short summary, as well? The speaker is named "Workflow Sauce"
```

```
Can you rewrite this transcript to be a much more readable, much more understandable, much more coherent and focused first-person narrative? Something that's, like I said, easy to read, right? It touches on all the details and all the nuance that is discussed in this monologue. 

Your response might be rather long. It depends on the actual density of the data of the bits. So if it has to be long, make it long, that's okay. If you want to do it in multiple parts, that's okay too.
```

## Raw transcript

Workflow Sauce  0:05  
Okay, I don't know if this is working. I don't care. I just somehow slipped into such a wonderful state. It's, it's lovely. I just took a nap like I finally got like a full night's rest last night, it was like seven and a half hours maybe, and I woke up feeling decent, and then man, just went through, had some stuff going on today. Met up with my recruiter, which is kind of weird. I walked in through how to use llms for for fun and profit, and that was pretty cool. I might actually turn that into a little, little mini course or video or something fun, just put out there, just kind of show off, like, Hey, you could do this right now. It's pretty useful. But, yeah, I did that. Had some really delicious coffee, and then I was just feeling kind of tired, so I took a nap, and then I woke up and it was okay. It was just like, yeah, yeah, I'm feeling good. And then as I was making coffee, I just felt so fucking elated. I was like, Oh, I recognize this feeling. This is like when my entire brain finally comes back online, when I've had a full night's best I remember the last time I felt like this. I actually tweeted about it. It was like I was walking to work, and it was like, Oh, this feeling of like everything is is perfect, you know, like everything's okay, and I don't need to push or pull or change or do anything. I remember it so clearly. And I was like, This is great. I slipped into, you know, whatever. I'm never gonna be able to find it, but looking it up right now, so long ago, but that was great. And then, you know, just going on, living life, doing things, and yeah, full full night's, rest. Like, the quality of life, difference between how I feel right now, like, I read a lot of Nick's tweets, and he just, like rants about, you know, perfect, like, like being happy and whatever it's like, yeah, yeah. Like, I just want to be alive right now. I swear. I'm only on caffeine. This is great. But then, yeah, just sitting down and working on my app and I saw some like, what is it? Some really interesting emergent behavior that I'm gonna write about and post about. And that was kind of cool. It just made me feel like, oh, wow, this is maybe there's something here. Yeah, it's like, maybe this is a worthwhile endeavor after all. And I wasn't just blowing smoke up my own ass. And then I hopped on hinge, and I just started complimenting all the ladies. And I just like, there's something that feels so good. This is kind of a throwback to miss G's flirting classes, like, just giving a really genuine like, like, it feels so fucking true. I just love looking at people's faces and just delivering those compliments like, I don't ever have to talk to you. Don't have to match with me. Okay, this is for you. It's like, take it and go and it just, it just feels so good, because then every single face, it's just like, I just zero in on this loving feeling of just like, you know, I have this feeling inside of me, just this overwhelming outpouring of love, and I just need to channel it into this person. It just feels so good to like, not even hold back. And just like I told this girl, like you look like you look like such a wonderful and easy person to spend time indiscriminately with, like, just looking at her smile and just like I could totally see, you know, just hanging out and just feeling so at ease. And I don't know if it's true or not, but he wanted to get it off. It feels good to put that out there into the ether, you know, and, yeah, just complimenting people in their taste and clothing and dress. And it's just like, it just feels so good, and that just kind of pushes this. I guess maybe this is what people feel and like, met them, meditation and stuff, just this feeling of just like, deep okayness, and it's so much better than MDMA, because I don't have that, like rushing feeling like, Oh, I gotta. I. Got to go do something or be it's just like, oh, just chill. Like, this is how I want my Sundays to be from now on. This is dope. Yeah, I'm going to see if there's anybody I can drag in here. There's not everybody's everybody's out in the world living their lives. I'm the only person on on Twitter, sound board, okay, okay, I love it. Oh yeah. So it's just, it's just such a nice feeling to my mind is relatively empty. I'm just happy being here. Nothing's popping up and yeah, just, I don't know what I can say, other than get a full night's rest. You won't, you won't regret it. Push through. Let's see, at home, in my body, everything looks perfect, man, I use the word perfect a lot. Think it's great. People want to preserve knowledge and tradition, peace and comfort. Let's see from workflow, sauce, everything. Let's say peace. I think peace would probably be, I know sometimes I'm searching my tweets and it like doubles up on the from, let's say peace. This. This app could be more usable. July.

Workflow Sauce  6:48  
Make peace within myself,

Workflow Sauce  6:57  
most at peace when you take away existential dread of the future and the guilt of the past. Oh yeah, that was a that was a fun one.

Workflow Sauce  7:14  
Many days I feel like I'm sparring with my ego. Some days are like this, where it all seems irrelevant, like I'm just being pulled into the future with a string without a string. I'm just happy to be along for the ride. Meta thoughts arise and dissipate, and that's meta, like thoughts about me, thoughts about this. I don't feel awake or asleep. I'm not worried about turning into this or that, not worried about growth or peace or expressing the deepest truths within me. I'm just here swaying in the wind. Yeah, I'm gonna, I can share this to random there it is. Not even worried about how to get back into this date I didn't get myself here. It's not bliss, it's not peace, it's not anything, not quiet, not loud. No center or hierarchy. Nothing grabs from my attention and repels it. Just watching it all. I guess this is it. I don't even know what this is. It's nothing has to be a certain way. Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is the thread I was I was walking down the post, down the street to work and just feeling like, damn, Everything's just fine. And not just like, oh, this is okay. I'm okay with this. But it's just like, there's no sense of like it being any other way. There's no sense of there being anywhere else. There's no sense of like here. But it's not in some like, weird, awakened transcend, like, oh my god, I'm tripping balls. It's just like, it's just so fucking plain, so, like, I don't even know that this is, like, some kind of an awakened state of whatever. Just like, no, just all this stuff is just off, and I'm just chilling in my house, and it's just boring, and there's no pole. There's no urge to go anywhere, to do anything. I mean, I'm I'm just sharing this because maybe there's a slight urge to remember this. I spent so much time spinning and turning and then kind of thrashing about that this is a nice reprieve, and maybe I could do this for myself a lot more often. But besides that, besides what I'm doing right here, just kind of being, being at that piece, I'm feeling that feels pretty nice. So, yeah, I

Workflow Sauce  9:49  
I love this other tree. I see no way, at least with my own faculties, to prove that peace is objectively, intrinsically better than desire. All are part of our birthright as humans. I wouldn't take one out. Sense of experience from another person without their consent. Yeah, I mean this whole samsory Nirvana thing. It's like, I don't know. I don't have anything interesting to say about that. I just find it funny. You have to make peace with your feelings on the outside before they let you in. Yeah, so what was I saying? There was, there was some other, oh, I was just sitting here, and I'm gonna post about this, because it's, it's related to the the app that I'm working on. That's what the insight came from. But I was just sitting here, I made the coffee, and I was feeling really good. I was just like, Oh yeah, I'm all right. Like, sleep is fucking dope. Oh my god. And then I come over here, and I sit down on the couch in front of the front window where the sun's coming, and it's really beautiful. It's really maybe I'll take a picture. Can I share? Can I tweet a picture of this. Let's see if I can, I can do this. I can access the camp. I can there's the there's the light, there's the front window, there's my little incense. Let's see what happens. Use, wait, use, no, okay, yeah, did it animate? Okay, it animated. But there's, there's no point because it, there's not much going on. Maybe even try that. You can see some smoke. Okay, let's see. It's dumb. Whatever use gifts. Post, so, yeah, I'm just sitting here with that, and it's just pleasant. You know, the sun's coming in. I sat down. There was, I was like feeling that and anticipating that, like, Oh, this is really nice. And then I felt this sense of like getting warm. It was actually pretty warm in here. And the strange fucking thing was, it started to feel bad, like I started to get lethargic, just in my body, in my mind, like this sort of mental and it was just like way ahead of the feeling of the warmth. It just, it was like a trigger, and it, it didn't really make sense. And then I didn't really process it at first, but then I used my app, and I told the app, I was like, you know, I'm feeling kind of warm. And I realized it's like, oh, because yesterday, I was hanging out with a friend at her place, and it was so hot that I just felt super lethargic and I didn't want to do anything. And then today, it felt like that, and it just sort of triggered immediately, like, very subconsciously, very automatically, like, oh, I guess it's just going to be hot and I'm going to be lethargic. And I just connected the dots. I was like, fuck. Emotions are like, you know, the programs, it's like, it's a thing to just sort of bring all this previous conditioning into the present moment. It just like, sort of prepares you for whatever, whatever stimulus you know, like, if you're feeling hot, or some loud sound scares you. Or somebody says, you know, hey, you're wrong. That's not appropriate to do. You're like, Oh, fuck. Like, what got me out of this situation in the past? Or how did I react before? Like, what was I feeling? It's like, it's almost like, in advance of the actual feeling of being too hot. Like, I wasn't feeling too hot, but I was warming up at a rate that kind of made my body feel like it might be, that makes sense. So it's just like it connected that down. I was like, Oh my God. Like emotions are from the past, and that just makes so much test. And it kind of like unhooked that for me, because I recently, for like, the last, I don't know, few months, as I do in more emotional work and, ah, just all this stuff, all these triggers, left, right and center, coming up, and just showing me all this, this ridiculous conditioning that, like, when I think about it, it's just so overwhelming, because there's just so much. There's like, there's, yeah, so it's, it's, there's just so much triggers. And when I think about it, I really want to, really want to just give up and just live life, yeah, but anyway, seeing that and thinking about that, it just feels like, Oh, these emotions are really just programmed, conditioned responses that sort of wrap up and bake in all this, this exposure and yeah, it's just, it's weird to think about that and think about emotions in that way, and feel like. Oh, it's just programming. It's not even some mystical special thing. It's just, it's just programming that's happening to me that I don't know, it takes some of the magic out of it. So just just going through that and seeing, like, how just temperature could trigger this feeling of lethargy that was like, so identified with, you know, these, these other feelings, like, yeah, just get up and cool off, like, turn on a fan and immediately change your situation. But it just like my brain and my body were just so ready to just chill. I'm like, Ah, it's too hot. I'm just gonna lay around and do nothing. You gotta, gotta interrupt that. So seeing, seeing the way that the emotion just kind of steers my entire mental and sort of physiological experience just on the drop of a hat. I'm just like, all right, all right. The mystery is is gone. You know, the mysticism, the magic is gone. These are just program scripts. These are ruts that we've carved. I don't know it's kind of funny. So yeah, let's see what else is going on today. Much I like I said, I was really excited about the the app, because you're seeing this emergent behavior of like, you know, you give it memory, and then you make like a passing comment about you know, person's name, and then it goes and thinks like, oh, maybe I should retrieve,

Workflow Sauce  16:37  
maybe I should retrieve some info about this person, right? Because there's a tag relevant to that, and then it does, and then it weaves that as an insight into its response. Like just seeing that happen just kind of threw me for a loop. Obviously, in this case, it's really small, it's just like, oh yeah, congratulations. You use this one useful fact that you know I've I've taught you inadvertently by talking a bunch to you. But at that moment, it kind of clicked for me that, like, hey, if I can figure out the more scalable way to both store and retrieve, you know, graph information, like, like facts, and hook this thing up to that, like, this could get extremely powerful. And it's sort of like it's, um, there's this guy on LinkedIn that I connected with who's doing like graph store, like graph knowledge graphs and stuff for llms and like marketing and stuff. And he's like, he's so he's so bullish, it's almost like ridiculous. Like I do, I can only take like, one or two of these posts a day, but now I can see the magic in it that, like, yeah, if it if the retrieval is really good, and you give the LLM enough agency over what it's doing, it can do some things that will surprise you, and that's the sort of emergent behavior is amazing. So I'm excited to see where it goes. I'm still mucking around with, like, flat files, like I've got the memory just as a single append only text file where every single, every single message just gets appended to it and just tails the last you know, 1020, 30 messages, which seems to be enough to have a coherent long term conversation with. Of course, it forgets obviously the older stuff, and then, like a poor man's knowledge graph, which is really just a JSON key value store, again, stored in a flat text file that it can write to and read from. So for every turn, I'll tell it the current tags, and it can retrieve any of those it wants. And it can sort of decide how much do you want to know about my friends versus you know, my ambitions versus, you know, my diet for any given turn, and that seems to work decently. The one thing I realized is, like, there needs to be a lot of contextual information stored around knowledge. Because, like, it's storing some things in there. Like, I sent it a sad face emoji, and it stored that. It's like, the user seems to be sad. It's like, Yeah, but that was like, last night. I'm okay now, so there needs to be some kind of temporal information. And I honestly like, I'd love to kind of give the LLM full range and say, hey, you know, do whatever you want to store this data and then revise your approach as you you learn. But I don't think it's ready for that level of responsibility just yet, but it's nice to see that, like there's, there's really a there, there with this, and especially the omnipresence that that was my core theory about this. My core hypothesis was like, if I had a way to just send one off messages to an LLM with low friction throughout my day, that I would do it and that it would yield some insights, and it really does. And like, I don't need to think about what I've said before, because it's pulling that information forward. And yes, it's very rudimentary, it's very kind of weak right now. But even that, like, it's it's still you. You know, like, Hey, you can talk to this friend because you mentioned that you know, you can confide in them and you trust them. It's like, Yeah, good point. Thank you. So that's that's a very fun and it's just like, Yeah, I was just noodling on this in my free time, and not with a lot of like, um, for direction. It's just something I enjoy doing that. The more I do it, the more I'm like, kind of thinking about and kind of wanting to tweak, but also not beating myself up for not not tweaking it too much. Anyway, that's me. I got Chad on the call. You want? You want to jump in as a speaker, Chad, you want to just, you want to just listen. It's fine. I'm recording this, so I've just been ranting myself. I didn't expect anyone to jump on so feel free to decline. If not, I'll continue to rant for a little bit longer. To think there's anything I can say, but I I just thinking about like, what can I? What can I do to sort of publish the the things that I'm working on in a useful way? Because, like, this morning I jumped on, like I said, with my recruiter, and walked him through some LLM stuff, and it's like, I think it would have been awkward to be like, Hey, man, Can I record this and, like, turn it into a podcast or something, but like, that is what I would have wanted to do, you know, like, that's, that's the fundamental disconnect. That's the fundamental frustration, is, like, I have these really meaningful and, like, personal conversations, like we ended up talking about, like, his his plans, like his life, stuff and all that. And it's like, it's really meaningful. And there's part of me that wants to be just like, super present for that and engage with them about that. And I think, you know, I think it was helpful to him. I just like, it's insightful, and I find that meaningful. But then there's a part of me that's like, this conversation could be really interesting to other people and really helpful to some people, especially people are, like, earlier on in their careers, and trying to figure out, you know, where to go and what to do, and to see this level of like, hey, you know, we're both in our 30s and climbing up there, by the way, but we're both in our 30s and we're we're not exactly sure where we want to go or What we want to do, or even, like, what criteria we want to use, you know, to determine, you know, it's like, do I want to be really successful, or is that just a means to an end, right? And so just that discussion. It was really good. It was, like, it was a couple of perspectives, and like, if I could get paid to do that full time, you know, just talk to random people, not like famous people want to tell you, like, this is how it is, but like random people who have done some research and tried to, tried to figure out their own answers. And, you know, maybe they're stuck, or maybe they figured it out. And it's like, this is just one perspective. This isn't, you know, authoritative, whatever, but that can be just as helpful to other people as, you know, some expert coming out and be like, Hey, we analyzed 100,000 people, you know, in their jobs, and we've decided that the average person is, you know, spherical and lives in a city and works for big tech. And it's like, okay, yeah, well, it's good for you. It's not good for the rest of us, just hosting a space talking, yeah, so sometimes, yeah, the that would be interesting. I'd love to figure out how to make that work and make that happen. For me, it's like, how do I, how do I do this in a way that feels like it's not just, you know, one off, and that's, that's a utilitarian in me. It's like, everything has to be for something else. Nothing could just be inherently okay. And it's kind of fun to look at it from, from the perspective that I landed into, you know, with a full night's rest, which is just like, actually, it's okay, you know. It's like, if there is more to be done and had from it that will emerge from it, you know, naturally, and it won't be something that I need to, like, carve out. It's like, imagine like a chick hacking from an egg. You're like, move over, chick, let me, let me crack the rest of this egg. For you. It's like that that hurts more than it helps. I always think about like something my my dad told me, is like when it when a child passes through the birth canal, like it squeezes their head, it squeezes their body. It forces, you know, fluid out of their lungs. And when a child is delivered via cesarean, like they have to go juice that baby themselves. And it's like, it would be nice, you know, if there wasn't fluid in our lungs, and we didn't have to go through that. But there's an element of, you know, you. You do have to kind of struggle. You do have to kind of squeeze through. And it's like, if there's something there, it'll come out, and if there's not, it's totally okay. And, yeah, I just, I want to give myself more permission to just do that stuff, and then, you know, share the stuff that I can so like all what I'll do, you know, in addition to mentioning here, what I'll do is document what I showed him and reflect on maybe some of the stuff that we talked about and some of the insights that I had from that, and just share those. The one thing that I'm really struggling with that. I really, I think it's kind of a blocker for me, is that I want to, I want to write prolifically, and I want to share prolifically in a way that invites feedback, that invites engagement, and I think one that's that's down to how I talk, it's down to how I communicate. That I think this is probably a whole science or whole study in and of itself, but I think there are ways of talking that sort of invite

Workflow Sauce  26:19  
real, sort of grassroots engagement. People are just like, Yeah, I don't I think it's this way, or I think it's that way. And then there's ways of talking that sort of just invite, sort of chime in democratic like, Oh yeah, totally this, oh yeah. That happens to me, lol. And there's actually many different ways, and there's probably, I tend to think, in like, spectrums and quadrants. So, like, the spectrum would be like, well, you know, it's a little bit this, or it's a little bit that, or somewhere in the middle, and a quadrant is, like, you know, political compass. And this could be, you know, like, I just love thinking of, like, continuous metrics that are semi orthogonal, orthogonal to each other. That is like, it's not just a or b, right? It's not just you generate engagement or you don't. It's like, what is the quality of engagement? Where does that engagement go? Is it just people thinking about things? Are they more motivated to act? And the kind of engagement that I would want is, I'm putting thoughts out there, I'm starting conversation. I want people to, to add their perspective, to add, you know, to get, get out stuff like, oh, this was useful, and this is good, but actually, that seems wrong, and then to put that back in. So it's really about creating an environment that is conducive to that, right? And that's, it's how you present, you know, whatever you're trying to present, it's the format. You know, where are you doing this? Like, a space like this is really good for short form conversation, but it doesn't invoke, like, I don't know if anybody's actually going to listen to this after the fact, besides me, and that's fine, okay, I'm just screwing around like, I had to say something somewhere. And it's like, instead of recording it and sending it to my bot, I thought it put it onto the world. But, you know, like, this kind of thing is useful for, like, from conversation. It's useful for like, sort of publicity seeking, you know, like, Hey, I'm like, I think Elon did a space with the vague. And I think he did one with Trump, like, that's, you know, this is like, new media, right? Which is great, you know, there's a room for that in our society. There's room for that in human sort of existence, whatever you want to call it, but that that doesn't really, it doesn't really do, like, I don't have anything to share. I have stuff I want to engage with people on to, like, a sort of a grassroots thing, like me and my friends is really good. But like, another thing that I want is, like, how do we create, like, a lot of social media is very temporal, so it's like, Twitter's, Twitter's a little bit better about this, but it's like all, I'll have an idea and I'll put it out there, and people engage with it. We'll go back and forth a little bit, but then it'll fall off, and new stuff is coming, and that's a product of social media, whereas we're always pressured to put new stuff out and not go back on the and sort of develop and refine the old stuff. Like Wikipedia is a cool example. Like Wikis are cool example of, like, hey, there's, there's value in, you know, trying to refine and distill our knowledge on topics and to have discussions. I think Wikipedia kind of puts a stark contrast between, you know, the discussions and the content. And I what I'm looking for is like something in between, you know, and I think there's, there's Twitter users who really do a great job, like the defender does a great job. Visa does a great job of like, managing their back catalog and pulling up relevant tweets that they've had. And I think with better tools. Think defenders really like hammering hard on, you know, export your tweets and do this. And I think the the more that we can get to, like, a real time, very indexed and like, like, my ideal would be an LLM that just sits right next to, you know, the the feed, and you can just talk to it, and it will pull up tweets and structure your feed and say, here's the discussion on this topic. And then you could just write a tweet and hit, you know, A, B, C and D, and they could be, you know, from 10 minutes ago. They could be from a year ago, five years ago, like, I don't know how Twitter's like, 2007 you reach back into the annals of history. So that would be, that would be really cool. But the other thing is, like, it's still hard to sift through, and still kind of feels incoherent. It still feels cramped, right? Because you have a tweet size limit, and even the longer tweets like those are so just like, it doesn't really feel conducive to the type of like, I want people to be able to think at length about things and respond at length, and engage at length over time, and come back and re engage. So, like, a blog was cool. I thought of like, oh, wouldn't it be wonderful if I could write a blog. And I actually did this and I posted it somewhere. I can't remember. I think, I think I posted under my real name, but, like, I wrote a blog, and then, actually, I didn't even write a blog, like, I rambled like this for you know, like, five minutes to otter. Otter.ai, just any kind of voice transcription, and then I put that into Claude, and I said, Hey, talk me through this. Like, help me flesh this idea out a little bit. We went back and forth, and I added more context and ideas, and we riffed, and I said, Okay, now help me write this down as a blog, and actually give me an outline and give me, like, some takeaways. And I structured this all into it, into a really I think it's innovative. And I think defender likes it too, like an innovative blog entry that you could just read the outline and decide if you wanted to read it right, and then you could read the sort of key insights or Takeaways or whatever, I can't remember exactly, and that was that was really cool. That was part of it. And then the actual blog entry, which Claude generates, and I kind of edited a little bit, so I love that, right? And then you could comment down below, and that's the part that I hate. It's, it's like, the the blog structure is like, this is me. And then it's like, yeah. And if you have comments like, like, squeeze them into the little box below. Good luck kid. And it, I want to open it more than that. And I want to have something where it's like, this is, this is the raw material. Now, you take this and ingest it, you know, and talk, speak to the parts that you care about, and ignore the parts you don't, you know, just chew this up. And so my thought was like, What if we put an LLM behind a blog, in front of a blog. And so like, instead of you landing on my blog and seeing each entry, you land on my blog. You see some titles, and you click on one. It's like, oh, here's the blog entry. But instead of reading that whole thing, why don't you chat about it, right? And so then you can just ask the element, give me a summary of this, right? And then it starts to spit that out to you. And then you say, oh, okay, yeah, so what about this? And then you're having a conversation. It's based in the blog, but it's actually you're adding your own context, which the LLM is seamlessly weaving into the blog. So instead of just a comment, you have the world's most relevant engagement, right? Because this person is talking to the blog entry from their perspective, and the LLM is sort of mediating both of that. And then once that's done, like that whole conversation, they can take that and turn that into their own blog entry, their own sort of response, as well as like, you can pull the info out of that and use that like, hey, now I can talk to my LLM about my blog with viewer comments enabled, right, and say, like, oh yes, some of your viewers felt this way. Some of them felt that way. And now we get into this weird sort of pseudo qualitative, pseudo quantitative metrics and feedback, where we have hyper detailed feedback from users that we have tools now to aggregate in ways that we never really could before, because you can take every bit of words that a user has said and the alums are really great fuzzy machine for kind of quantizing, like qualitative data, right? It's like, fundamentally, language is sort of in a superposition of, you know, quantitative and qualitative, which is, it's fascinating that the words are fuzzy and you. I could do a whole space on this, but the LLM can, it lives in that space. It's made of that space like it is the language. And so it's actually better at doing this than we are, because this is, like, its entire existence. And so you can tell it like, hey, you know, turn this into numbers, and it'll just make shit up and it like it's internally consistent. And if you make that do that over a huge data set of you know, knowledge and information, it can do it in such a way that you can derive meaningful insights. It's like embedding, right? That's the word embedding. It's like embedding all of those responses in one space, one unified space that you can then almost do math over. And that's that's really exciting. So I think we're at the cusp of a new type of market research. And I don't see a lot of people doing this, like, oh, you can talk to an LLM and it'll assume, it'll assume the persona of your customers. You can do UX and market research, or it can help, you know, talk to you. But it's like we can get people's actual feelings, you know, directly from their conscious and subconscious usage of language and and extract that in ways that we've never been able to do before. So we're really at the cusp of, like,

Workflow Sauce  36:21  
I don't even know, like, an unknowable number of revolutions in an unknowable number of fields. I don't I don't know, like, My intuition tells me this is every field everywhere, and that in some ways, like AI is overhyped, because, like, oh, it's going to solve every problem for us. And, you know, scratch our butts and sniff our armpits. But that's not true. It's gonna be quite a while until we have like, ASI or AGI that, just like, solves every human problem before they exist. But this paradigm, this paradigm of, you know, putting the LLM in front of all these things that we used to go through all these, these acrobatics and gymnastics to turn into insights like that's That era is coming to a close, and I think sooner than anybody thinks, and when it switches over, we're sort of entering a new space, a new playing field, very level, but like, very open for innovation. So it's just like, it's almost like, shut down this version of the matrix and start the new one up. And it's like, totally uncolonized, all right, start building everything from scratch in this new paradigm. And I'm sure plenty of people see this. I'm not like some lone genius, but it's just that sort of exists between the llms are overblown and they're the new crypto and the oh my god, you know, AI is going to take all our jobs and subjugate humans as its little fleshly. It's like, yeah, no, no on both fronts, it's actually way more interesting and exciting than that. And some people see it, and some people are just still, you know, meming it up. I think, I think one of the call me a nuance here, but like, one of the things that I think, at least for me personally, one of the things that determines how interesting you are to me is your capacity for nuance. And if, if you see everything in black and white, it's like, I love you. I'll engage with you. That can be helpful for me, you know, that's great, but I it's just after a certain point in time, it's like your your lack of capacity to hold two conflicting ideas in your head, it's going to become a burden. Like, I still struggle with that, like I'm not some, yeah, I'm not some enlightened being with like I could hold the cosmos in my little pinky and still have room for another multi is it's not like that, but I can appreciate that things are not what they appear to be to me, and that even you know, all of my best, most enlightened views are still vague imitations of reality. And that's and that's fine. Yeah, it's cool. Tell me. Tell me I'm wrong. Explain how and I'd be I'd be happy to be proven wrong. So anyway, back off of that weird tangent to, I want to build, you know, a blogging system where it's an LLM on top of that. And so it's like, comment first, it's like, the way that you engage and ask the LLM, you know, what is this about? And can you explain it like I'm five, and like, oh, that sounds like such and such thing, like having that conversation with it, rather than just reading one way through and getting distracted half the time you're not as engaged, and then you write a comment that's like, great article, thanks. It's like, what a waste of everybody's time that would be versus like, Wow, you really engage with this in a very Socratic and back and forth way. And the writer of the article got tons of feedback out of that, even if you hated it and you thought he was a loser. Like, that's good feedback, because he knows why you thought he was loser. He knows what parts he you hated. And. He can, he can engage with that. And maybe you're right, right? Like, maybe he is a loser. If I'm a loser, please tell me. So that's, that's a key portion of that. But then, then there's, like, if you did like it and it did resonate, and you have other insights to add to this, that's excellent too, right? So, I mean, that's a huge win. And then, like, on top of that is, how do we have kind of a federated, loosely related it's like, I love the Google doc model, where I can write a doc and I can invite you to write into that, and you can comment on it. I can respond to those comments. The problem is, I own the doc. Problem is these things can't sort of exist in parallel. So we need some kind of like UX paradigm, where I have some writing and you have some writing, and almost I'm torn. It's like, Is it, is it a paradigm, or are we post paradigm? And it doesn't really matter where the data lives. It really just matters. You know, we've let the llms sort of keep the data and just present to us. What is, you know, in the doc, the doc just becomes ephemeral. It's like, All right, here's my new idea in the LMS. Well, you know, workflow said three weeks ago over here and this and this conversation that that was irrelevant, and it's for these reasons, you're like, oh, okay, thanks, cool. So you don't, there's, there's a potential that, like the best interface, literally is no interface. You're just, you just have this magical data Munger that that just has access to everything and tells you what's relevant, and you just sort of interface with it through, you know, speech or text or whatever, visuals. And it just has the ability to generate and present those and then eventually, you know, neuralink comes, and we're just, we're just floating in cyberspace in our minds whenever we want, then that's that's the interface that just creates these, creates and imbues us with these gestalts, ad hoc on the fly, you just see, you see the answers in your mind's eye. Yeah, so, man, that's exhausting to think about. Is all so much fun. But I'm just like, Oh, these ideas are things I've been been holding on to for a while, so it's nice to get them out and just let it go. So I will just continue to work on my little, my little telegram bot. And, oh, yeah, so that commenting thing like I did create a GitHub and I did, I did this with one of defenders posts so like he, and I sent this to him. He, he posted something about, like, advertising. He's doing so many cool sting things. And I liked it, and so I copied it into a GitHub post, and I commented on it, and yeah, here it is. So he, he wrote something, he posted on on, you know, the the website that we're not supposed to talk about. And I was like, Oh, cool. I'm going to take this as an opportunity to use my my workflow. So this is my writing feedback workflow, very clunky, right now I'm just sharing this to the space. So on this, I copied his post, and then I did inline quotes with my initial to comment on it in line, right? So this was kind of the best, the best I could come up with, you know, using GitHub. But I could just easily, like, dump his article into an LLM. Like, my ideal workspace is LLM and Docs and like being able to highlight docs and star them and comment on pieces. So like my right now, the best conceptualization I can come up with is something like figma. I've seen some guys, they message me where you could just paste anything in. So I could take a YouTube video, I could take a tweet, I could take a string of tweets, some screenshots, some web pages. I could paste a URL, and it would transcribe that and then, but you. So on those I could say, hey, you know, transcribe this and then summarize or sort of unfold it, right? Let me watch it and like. So if it's a YouTube video, comment on this, this section right? And then, if it's a web page, you know, highlight this image or comment on this or draw on this. So this, this sort of workspace, this whiteboard, where you could comment and annotate on anything, and then you could talk to an LLM. And the LLM would sort of have that context. So depending on how busy it gets like you would,

Workflow Sauce  45:40  
you would either take all the data and use that as context, or it would do some kind of treat retrieval or index on that data. But the highlights, the comments, those would get into a preferential, separate stack, separate layer of context that ideally would all be stored there again as it grows like then they would do retrieval over that, or do like time based retrievals or whatever you commented on most recently would be prioritized to have all these kind of recommendation algorithms, sort of ways to determine what gets inserted into context. But the idea is, you're interacting in this workspace, and other people can jump in here too and comment potentially, and then you're talking to an LLM about what's in the workspace. And you can take bits and pieces of what the L that that specific conversation, or multiple conversations with the LLM, maybe of different instances, and you can bring those into the space and into the context so people can comment on those, and again, feed that into new terms of the conversations. And every single aspect of this is like, visible. So like, if I want to talk about a specific instance, I think cursor does this. Like cursor the IDE does this really well, where, like, when I'm talking to the LLM, I can mention a specific file or folder, I can select some text in the terminal or in a specific file, and I can paste in images. And so that's, that's kind of what I'm getting at, is like, Okay, for the next turn or for this conversation. So very fluid context management, like you have the explicit context which is like, I absolutely want you to use this file, I absolutely want you to use this image and this comment. And then you have the sort of subjective context, which is kind of a semi hidden layer where it's like, it decides if it wants to pull other stuff into and maybe you can have explicit ignores, like, do not use this right? Do not touch this file. So you could, you could do that in figma. You could select and say, like, hey, I want this video on this web page. Okay, about these two, right? Or you could do that via a list of all the highlights and comments that you could search through and filter through on time. So it'd be, it'd be a really interesting way to work. And I think like that would be where I would spend most of my time is in that interface where it's just, like you just dump facts in there, and it indexes them and helps you kind of sift through and manage, and then you can talk to an LLM, which gives you an additional layer of like, okay. You don't have to dig through all this stuff. It can find and retrieve and search and distill for you. So it really, it would save you a lot of time, but make that process a lot more fluent. So that's, that's how I see it going. Just thinking about all this stuff. So I don't know if I'll ever work on that, or if I'll work on that next, but that would be, you know, potentially, like you could, you could do this. You could have a research workspace where you're just, like, working on stuff, any, any kind of hard problem, even this, right, like I could, I could take the space and put it into to that, like trying to refine, like, what's the best tool for building this? And then you could share those. You could open it up. You could you could share it as sort of read only where it's like, your private version is, like, you get to control what goes in there. But somebody could fork it, you know, and start from where you were, and add their own, their own layer to it, and they could sort of take yours and use that as a data source. So they could take it and paste it into a new one. They could paste someone else's. So the idea of, like, being able to sort of pass these things around, almost like tarballs, right, almost like, like data bundles, and then draw off of them for new versions. I just it's such a beautiful idea in my mind, because it then frees us up to pass this data around and new and interesting ways. So that is what I'm thinking about these days. Let's see. Doesn't tell me how long I've been on the space i. But I feel like it's been a little bit and I'm getting a little bit burnt out. So I'm gonna wrap this one up. If anybody listens to this comment on it, or tell me something, you know, if there's anything interesting in here, if not, it's just for me, and you guys are missing out or not. Cheers. You.
