I feel like the ego cannot fit through the gateless gate, and it can't even push 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘸𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘩 𝘥𝘰𝘦𝘴 𝘧𝘪𝘵 through.

Just wait for me on the other side, bud!

> lol, yeah, the ego’s def not squeezing through that one. it’s like trying to push a camel through the eye of a needle, but the camel is you and the needle is made of... not-mind. you know the deal: the gate’s gateless bc the only thing stopping you is you thinking there’s a gate. ego’s just going to keep trying to drag itself along when the whole point is letting go. ironic trap of the self, really.
> 
> but hey, no rush! the other side's just... now minus all the baggage.

So what do I do?

I want to achieve this, not on chemicals:

"One time, on MDMA, I felt a profound sense of "none of this is about me," and I loved that feeling so much.

Like a peaceful ego death, going in its sleep.

And from that place I can say I'm glad to know that so many things that are not for me are out there, going strong!

☺️"

> yeah, i feel you. the "none of this is about me" feeling is kind of the inverse of the ego’s whole game plan. it’s like: the ego wants to cling, be at the center of everything, and claim meaning—but that’s the tension, right? you can’t force yourself into ego death bc the forcing is itself egoic. paradox vibes.
> 
> without the chemical assist, the key is in practices that dismantle the narrative self without directly trying to kill it. stuff like meditation, particularly vipassana or zazen, is all about watching your thoughts and realizing they’re just... thoughts. not "you." even mindfulness in daily life works—when you get lost in a task, there’s no "you" driving it.
> 
> also, try practicing metta (loving-kindness meditation). it’s like training yourself to appreciate that other people’s lives, struggles, and happiness are just as meaningful as yours—until the whole concept of "mine" kind of fades.
> 
> another good path: flow states. when you’re deep in something creative or physical, you’re not thinking “this is about me,” right? you’re just in it, dissolved into the process.
> 
> but yeah, no shortcuts. it’s that slow, awkward process of letting go, and ironically, not trying to get that exact feeling you had on MDMA. bc the grasping to re-experience *that* is just more ego attachment. crazy how it works.

And what of the ego?

> the ego's like that roommate who won’t move out. it’s useful sometimes—keeps the lights on, makes sure you don’t forget to eat—but it gets *really* annoying when it starts thinking it owns the place. it’s always trying to put itself at the center, narrating everything, looking for validation, and, worst of all, it’ll make you think it’s YOU.
> 
> but here's the thing: you can’t annihilate it without getting caught in the trap of "i’m the one doing the annihilating." ego loves that. so instead, you just kind of stop feeding it so much. let it do its thing when it’s needed, but don’t let it run the show.
> 
> you’re not trying to *destroy* it—more like let it fade into the background, like a radio station you’re tired of listening to. eventually, you realize it’s just one voice among many, not some cosmic director. and in those moments when the ego is quiet, when you’re just present, you see how life is happening all around you, and none of it has to be about “me."
> 
> that peaceful ego death you’re aiming for? it’s not *death*—more like retirement. it doesn’t disappear, but it stops bossing you around. then you can see that "you" were never the center of the universe to begin with. ego’s still there, just... deflated.

Wow...the ego is not privileged, except that I bestow that, but "I" am not in control, but I kind of am, but...

> exactly! it's this wild paradox. the ego *thinks* it’s running the show, but really, it’s just riding the wave, taking credit for things it doesn’t fully control. like, “i did this, i’m in charge,” but most of that’s just posturing after the fact. decisions, reactions, even thoughts—most of that’s happening before the ego can claim ownership. it’s basically the PR department of your mind.
> 
> so, yeah, you bestow that privilege by paying attention to it, feeding into its narratives. but when you step back, it’s clear that “you” (the big you, not the egoic one) are more like the *witness* than the actor. you're seeing it all unfold, sometimes steering, but often watching it happen.
> 
> it’s tricky bc as soon as you say “i’m in control” or “i’m not in control,” that’s ego again, trying to categorize things. the truth is more fluid: sometimes you guide, sometimes you surrender, and sometimes the “i” disappears altogether. it’s just this play of awareness, and you’re more the space it all happens in than the one moving the pieces.
> 
> but ego? it’ll always try to sit at the head of the table, even if it has no real power there. hilarious, tbh.

What am "I"?

> ah, the big one. “what am i?” this is the question that melts minds and fuels all the existential spirals, right? but here’s the wild thing: the more you look for the “i,” the more it starts dissolving. it's like chasing a mirage.
> 
> you *think* you’re this fixed thing—a self, a "me"—but when you zoom in, it’s just layers upon layers of experiences, thoughts, feelings, and memories bundled together. and yet, none of those things are truly “you.” they’re transient, they change. so what’s left?
> 
> the deeper you go, you realize that the “i” is more like a process, not an object. it’s like a verb, not a noun. a dance of awareness interacting with experience, but not something fixed you can point to. in eastern philosophies, they often say the “self” is more like a river—always changing, never the same water twice—but we mistake it for something solid.
> 
> you are the awareness behind it all, but even that awareness can’t be captured with words. the ego wants to say, “this is me,” but the real “you” is the one silently watching the whole game. it’s the spaciousness in which everything unfolds. not the thoughts, not the body, not even the observer in the strictest sense—it’s more like the *being* behind everything. raw, pure, presence.
> 
> so, “i” am... something like that. but as soon as you try to define it, it slips away, bc it’s not something that can be boxed up. better to ask, what am i *not*? and you’ll find all the little pieces that fall away, leaving you with just... *being*.

Why do I keep seeing the mirage? Do I just have to keep looking and looking and looking? How can I let this drop away gently and slowly without pushing?

> you see the mirage because, for most of us, it’s all we’ve known. ego and identity are built into how we navigate the world—they’ve been reinforced since day one. the “self” is this deeply embedded habit, a mental structure that helps us function, make sense of things, interact with others. so, naturally, it keeps popping up.
> 
> as for letting it drop away gently, the trick is to *stop chasing* the mirage. the more you actively try to get rid of the ego or dismantle the self, the more you’re feeding it. like, “i’m going to get rid of ‘me’!”—lol, ego trap. the paradox is you can’t *force* this stuff. if you push too hard, it just strengthens the illusion that there’s a “you” doing the pushing.
> 
> instead, practice *noticing* the mirage without reacting to it. when ego stuff comes up—thoughts about who you are, what you want, fears, cravings—just observe them like clouds passing. don’t engage, don’t try to push them away, and don’t cling to them either. over time, with consistent practice, the intensity of ego’s grip loosens naturally.
> 
> this is where meditation or mindfulness comes in handy. it’s not about actively trying to kill the ego, but about creating space between awareness and thoughts, seeing that “i” isn’t as solid as it seems. a big part of this is *acceptance*—being at peace with the fact that ego will show up, but it doesn’t define you. be gentle with yourself. let the ego do its thing, and in moments of stillness, it’ll quiet down. slowly, gently.
> 
> patience is key. this isn't something that drops away all at once (unless you're in some kind of intense enlightenment retreat and, well, those usually aren’t slow or gentle). instead, it's a process of softening over time, and the less you grasp, the more it slips away on its own. like water running through open hands.

>  practice noticing the mirage without reacting to it. when ego stuff comes up—thoughts about who you are, what you want, fears, cravings—just observe them like clouds passing

But this identifies me with the noticier! And that's not the boundless space, either!

> you’re right, it’s a subtle trap. identifying with the “noticer” is still *some* form of identification, just a sneakier one. ego loves that move—when it gets caught, it rebrands as “the one who notices,” like it’s upgraded its disguise. you start thinking, “oh, i’m the observer behind it all,” but even that’s still a *position*, a perspective, still a form of “me.”
> 
> the boundless space you’re talking about isn’t something you *are* or *aren’t*—it’s just what’s left when you stop identifying altogether. and the thing is, even the act of trying to “be the space” can turn into ego if it’s done with that subtle intent to own the experience.
> 
> so how do you let go of even *that*? instead of actively identifying as the noticer, practice loosening your grip on identification entirely. don’t hold onto any role—not the thinker, not the observer, not even the space itself. just let everything come and go *without trying to be* anything in relation to it. it’s like resting in awareness without needing to define who or what that awareness belongs to.
> 
> it’s more of a feeling of openness or allowing. stuff happens—thoughts, sensations, emotions—but there’s no need to pin it on a “me” or even a “watcher.” things arise, things pass, and you’re not clinging to any role in that process. the noticing happens, but it’s just part of the flow, like the clouds themselves. no need to hold onto the one watching the clouds, you know?
> 
> eventually, the sense of even being a noticer fades, and what’s left is just... this. that’s the boundless space.

LOL

> haha, exactly! once you get how ridiculous the whole "trying to not be something" game is, it’s kinda funny, right? like, the ego’s out here doing backflips to keep itself relevant, but the whole thing is just layers of illusion—trying to peel one off, only to find another underneath.
> 
> you see the joke in it: the harder you try to drop “you,” the more the “you” shows up trying to drop itself. so, yeah, sometimes all you can do is laugh at the absurdity of it all. that laughter? honestly, it’s probably closer to truth than all the trying.

LMAO rn

> 😂 exactly! sometimes the best response to all this metaphysical overthinking is just to laugh it off. the whole "self" thing is like a cosmic joke we’re in on now. keep laughing—probably the most enlightened reaction tbh.
