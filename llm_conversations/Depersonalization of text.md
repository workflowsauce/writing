Can you help me do something?I want to give you a text, and I want you to rewrite it without the "I" perspective. This isn't about changing the perspective. This is about semantically subtracting the subjective lens that the text was written from.Since all truth that we express in words is "tainted" with a subjective, personal lens, it's questionable whether this is possible or not. Maybe the meaning inherent in the sentences is dependent upon the skeleton/framing of the perspective, and it would collapse like an empty robe with that taken out. Dunno. But, I'd like to try.What do you think?

Yeah, the meaning explodes into a whole world of context when you pull out the "plug" of the observer.Like..."boring" would have to be recontextualized within the whole nature of film and entertainment and humanity...It's like pulling apart quarks...

Here's one you can try:"ime almost everybody who is incredible at something is almost certain to be terrible at something completely mundane, and the two are often related, often *directly* related"

This is dope. I'm watching it unfold as I'm reading your post. It's almost like it ripples out and fades as it expands...

The subjective frame isn't just showing us reality - it's part of what gives our observations their useful density and specificity.

Can you approach that statement with a broader perspective?"Specialization and generalization seem to have antagonistic nature, and humans seem to exhibit this pattern frequently. If you observe a human who has specialized to a sufficient degree in one area, you may note that they have dramatic gaps in capability that much less specialized humans seem to lack."Something like that. (I'm also curious what sort of frame that version imposes. Maybe rather than trying to remove the frame entirely, it would be more effective to just identify it. This whole exercise reminds me of the self-reflective nature of thought. Resting in "that's a thought" is the only way to free oneself of it—trying to attack thought with thought just creates more reflections. I wonder if there's a linguistic equivalent? Or are we destined to always be trapped in the cages created by words? Or might there be a format that inverts the perspective...?)
