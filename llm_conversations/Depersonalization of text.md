Can you help me do something?I want to give you a text, and I want you to rewrite it without the "I" perspective. This isn't about changing the perspective. This is about semantically subtracting the subjective lens that the text was written from.Since all truth that we express in words is "tainted" with a subjective, personal lens, it's questionable whether this is possible or not. Maybe the meaning inherent in the sentences is dependent upon the skeleton/framing of the perspective, and it would collapse like an empty robe with that taken out. Dunno. But, I'd like to try.What do you think?

Yeah, the meaning explodes into a whole world of context when you pull out the "plug" of the observer.Like..."boring" would have to be recontextualized within the whole nature of film and entertainment and humanity...It's like pulling apart quarks...

Here's one you can try:"ime almost everybody who is incredible at something is almost certain to be terrible at something completely mundane, and the two are often related, often *directly* related"

This is dope. I'm watching it unfold as I'm reading your post. It's almost like it ripples out and fades as it expands...

The subjective frame isn't just showing us reality - it's part of what gives our observations their useful density and specificity.
