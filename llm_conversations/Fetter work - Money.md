# Fetter work: Money

[fetters 4 and 5.txt]

Can you walk me through this, interactively? Ask me questions and prompt me to do or practice whatever is relevant.

> Alright, let’s break this down and dive into it interactively. The guide you provided focuses on self-inquiry, specifically dealing with the fourth and fifth fetters—desire and ill will. The process requires reflection, identifying your triggers, and staying with the "gap" between the stimulus and your reaction. Ready to practice?
> 
> Step 1: Identifying the Trigger
> 
> Let’s start here. Think about a situation, relationship, or issue that triggers strong reactions in you. It should be something recurring and significant, like a difficult relationship, a major life stressor, or something deeply frustrating.
> 
> **Prompt:**
> 
> - What’s the first thing that comes to mind?
> 
> - Can you describe the situation briefly and how it affects you emotionally or physically?
> 
> Take your time with this step—it’s important to pinpoint something with enough emotional energy behind it.

I want to work on my relationship with money. This one might be really, really hard because I don't feel anything. And I think that's the problem. So quick background, when I was in college I was super poor. And I had to check my bank account before I would buy groceries. It was just a real struggle. It was a lot of stress. And when I got my first job, I made so much more money that I didn't have to do that anymore. And I've never had to do that since then. And something about that transition just gave me such relief, such joy that I felt pride. And overspending on food, on overspending on things I'm consuming. And I thought, "Oh, I want to work really, really hard and build up a nest egg. I want to be rich so that I can do what I want." Because I felt free from the paycheck to paycheck thing, but I still felt like I had to work endlessly, otherwise I couldn't support my lifestyle. And what I really wanted was the freedom to explore and learn and be creative and expressive. And I just felt tethered to work. And then I went through a divorce. And during that year, I was terrified about not having money. So I worked three jobs. I took a second job and I was going to quit my first one. I decided not to. And I had a side project that unfortunately wasn't actively paying me money because I had already collected all the money. And so I was just working on that because I didn't want to give the money back. And I didn't want to tell them, "Hey, we need more money." Because it was my fault, long story. And through that year, I think I made like $400,000 that year. It was the most money I've ever made in one year in my life. And I had like 100 grand saved up after the divorce. Maybe more than that. And I just felt so safe. And I was like, "Oh my God, I saved myself." And then, you know, I switched jobs and I bought a new house. And for a year, I tried to do my own business. And I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. And I burned through all my savings. And I had to start working again. And now I have, you know, an hourly consultant gig. And I have some back taxes I haven't paid. And it's a little stressful. But I'm okay. And I'm building my savings back up. And I'm coming into it. And it's just, it's fine. But the underlying thing is still there. It's like, I want to be more creative. I want to be more expressive. But I'm sort of trapped in this place of comfort with money. And I, since the divorce and since all of this, I've paired it back quite a bit. I don't really spend as much frivolous money. I don't spend as much on food. I like to cook, you know, my own food. I'm a lot more conservative with it. But when I am doing something, I like to be able to spend money freely without thinking about the constraints. So I took my girlfriend to Hawaii recently. I took her out to dinner and I paid like $500 for the dinner. And I just felt really good doing that without feeling guilty or constrained. You're like, "Ugh!" But I did feel at the end of the trip like, "Wow, yeah, I spent more on this trip than I expected. And I'm going to have to save it back up. You know, I'm going to get back and get to work." So I don't, I have a sense that there's a lot of compensation in here. But I don't really know how to peel it back and get to what I'm actually feeling about money. because they think I'm holding it in the distance.

> This is rich and deeply layered—let’s work through it piece by piece. We’re looking at a relationship with money that’s deeply tied to survival, freedom, pride, fear, security, creativity, and even love. It’s not just "money"; it’s a whole web of emotions, beliefs, and patterns. Let’s dig into it systematically.

> We want to zoom in on the "push-pull" with money. Based on what you said, I’m hearing a tension between *freedom* and *safety*. You want the freedom to create and express without worrying about money, but you’re tethered to working to maintain that safety net. Let’s bring this into focus.

Well, as soon as I read what you said, "survival, freedom, pride, fear, security," I felt an overwhelming flash of emotion. I'm like, "Whoa!" I'm terrified. I think when I said the word "survival," that's when I got terrified. I'm really afraid of being out on the street. I'm really afraid of scrounging for money, not having enough. And so I have a whole suite of behaviors and compensations that keep me from even getting close to that. And I have a whole bunch of beliefs in top of like, "I've been letting you save it up," and I could sell my house, and I could downsize, and I would do whatever I have to do as long as I don't get into that state. Because I could be in that state with the alimony, right? It's like, "Oh, I can't even afford to do whatever." You don't just have to be poor to be in paycheck to paycheck. You just have to live beyond your means. And so after the divorce, that's where I made the real changes. I want to live within my means rather than constantly trying to get more jobs and more money and my rates and all these things, because that's a treadmill that I don't want to be on. It's completely orthogonal to the direction I want to go. When I think about money now, what's the strongest association? Well, that's a funny thing. When I think about money, it's nothing. It's just a thing. It's just paper. Because it both means something and it doesn't, right? So to me, it's just a number. They're just numbers. My current relationship with money is just necessity. It's just like, "Well, I have to have it. I have to use it. I have to earn it." But it's just like my relationship with air. You know, it's like, "I'm breathing because my body requires it, but I don't have feelings about air, although sometimes when I breathe deeply, I feel really good." But it's not about the air. The air is just a mechanism for feeding my body with oxygen. Okay, physical and emotional signals. Imagine my bank account downloads. What happens in my body? What happens in my pulse? It's so weird. I feel anxiety and relief at the same time. I feel this tension and I feel this spaciousness. It's so weird. It's like I feel anxiety because it feels fragile. The balance feels fragile. It could be washed away in any moment, but I feel relief because I have that balance and I can use it for things that it's more than I need and that feels relieving. I think that between desire and reality, if I waved a magic wand and had all the money I ever needed, I'd say, "That's a problem." Because if I had infinite money and nobody knew about it and the economy didn't crash because of it, which is what I would wish for with a magic wand, I would just be so detached from the nature of life. I would just go on a trip tomorrow. I would just book a flight to Japan. I would quit my job. I would just talk to people, buy things for people, buy things for myself. I would be so wasteful and so unconcerned. What's stopping me from starting a small part of that? I mean, to some extent, I do that now. The calculus is just so clear. It's like I want to go on another trip. I want to go to Japan with my friend. I don't know if I have enough money to do that. I have to pay taxes. I have to pay bills. I have to pay my mortgage. I may have other things coming up. I have other things that I want to do. They all fight for supremacy. I want to pay for classes and things. It's just I have to work. You can see that there's a pattern of, "I have to. I have to. I must." Identifying compensation patterns. Treating her to dinner. When I spend freely, I'm amplifying that sense of ease. A presence of just giving myself abundance in the moment. And I can just enjoy the abundance with ease. Because that's when I spent the $500 dinner. It was like, "Oh, I want this thing." And I want to take that feeling of, "Well, do I get to have it or what do I do?" I want to take the calculation out of it. So spending lavishly without thinking is my way to give myself what I want without the string of, "Well, you're going to have to pay for this later or this is going to come out of your paycheck or you might have to work twice as hard." I just want to enjoy things. And I want to want things. I want to want nice things. And I want to enjoy that without restriction. The belief is... I don't know what the belief is. It's just, let's just focus on the parts that we like. Because my girlfriend was like, "Oh, this is kind of expensive." It's like, "No, this is just a one-time thing. But while we're celebrating, let's really celebrate." I'm not going crazy, but I am taking the cap off of this. Working in the gap. I think that the feeling is, "I will always have to work to earn enough money to do what I want to do." And I'm always going to have this thing running in the back of my head saying, "You got to work and you don't have enough to do what you want to do. It's not safe." And it's just this combination of running and then feeling like I'm getting caught up with it. Running and it's just like, "I can't get away from it." It's like running on a hamster wheel. Why do I need to react to money? Because if I don't have enough, I won't be able to spend eventually. It'll catch up with me eventually. Okay, if all of my money in my bank account disappeared tomorrow, I'd have credit cards. I'd be able to take out loans. But I would have to pay those back. And no amount of saving feels safe because the money could disappear. Expenses can come out of nowhere. If anything, money is just a buffer. It's just an overflow mechanism for effort and work. That's how I see it. I don't see money as value. I did this for you and this produces real value for people. I'm stuck in seeing it. It's just like the honey that you take out of the beehive.

> Wow, you’ve unpacked so much here—thank you for laying it all out so clearly. There's a lot of nuance and power in what you’ve shared. Let’s break this down into actionable insights, and keep peeling back the layers. Here’s what stands out and how we can dig deeper:
> 
> 1. **The Core Fear: Survival and Fragility**
> 
> You felt that flash of terror when you thought about survival, being out on the street, and scrounging for money. Even though you’re far from that situation now, the fear is clearly still alive and influencing your behaviors.
> 
> Exploration:
> 
> - Can you identify where that fear feels strongest in your body? (Does it show up as tension, tightness, or something else?)
> 
> - Does this fear feel like "you"? Or is it more like an echo—a residue of past experiences like college or the divorce?
> 
> Try sitting with that fear. Breathe into it. What happens when you let it be there, without trying to push it away or fix it?
> 
> 2. **The Push-Pull Between Freedom and Responsibility**
> 
> You’ve got this fascinating tension: a desire for abundant freedom (e.g., spending without calculation, traveling spontaneously) and the voice that constantly says, *“You have to work. You have to be responsible. You can’t stop.”*
> 
> Exercise:
> 
> Imagine this tension as two characters in a dialogue:
> 
> - One says: “I want freedom. I want to enjoy abundance without worrying about paying for it later.”
> 
> - The other says: “You need to be careful. If you’re not responsible, everything could fall apart.”
> 
> **What would these two characters say to each other?** What would you say to them, as the mediator?
> 
> 3. **Money as a Buffer, Not Value**
> 
> You described money as “just a buffer, an overflow mechanism for effort and work.” It’s like the honey from the beehive: something extracted through hard labor, stored away, but always at risk of being depleted. This view is practical, but it also feels... mechanical.
> 
> Inquiry:
> 
> - What would it feel like to see money as a tool for creating, rather than just surviving?
> 
> - If money wasn’t tied to “effort and work,” what would it represent to you? (Joy? Possibility? Love?)4. **The Belief: “No amount of saving feels safe”**
> 
> You’ve hit on a critical belief here: *“No amount of saving feels safe because money could disappear.”* This belief keeps you in a cycle of working, saving, and still feeling vulnerable.
> 
> Challenge the Belief:
> 
> - Can you recall a time when this belief wasn’t true? A moment when saving actually did create a sense of safety or relief?
> 
> - What if this belief wasn’t “true”—what would change about how you relate to money?5. **The Desire for Ease and Abundance**
> 
> Spending lavishly, like the $500 dinner, is your way of *breaking free* from the hamster wheel, even temporarily. You want to experience the *feeling* of ease, generosity, and joy without the strings of guilt or fear.
> 
> Prompt:
> 
> - Can you imagine creating that same feeling of abundance without spending money? What would it look like to feel rich in time, creativity, or connection instead of dollars?6. **The Question: Why React to Money?**
> 
> You asked an important question: *“Why do I need to react to money?”* Your current answer is tied to survival—if you don’t react, you might lose everything. But what if the reaction itself is part of the trap?
> 
> Inquiry:
> 
> - What happens if you just notice your thoughts about money without reacting to them? For example, if you see a bill and feel that flash of anxiety, can you pause and let the feeling move through without acting on it?
> 
> This is the "gap"—the space where you can observe your reaction without being swept away by it. The more you practice staying in this space, the less power those reactions will have over you.
> 
> 7. **A Vision of Freedom**
> 
> You’ve painted a vivid picture of what freedom looks like: traveling spontaneously, being creative, giving generously, and living without the “I have to” voice running in the background.
> 
> Visualization Exercise:
> 
> - Close your eyes and imagine yourself living that life.
> 
> - What’s the first thing you notice about how it feels? Is there joy, peace, or something else?
> 
> - Now ask yourself: What’s one small step I could take today to move closer to that vision?
> 
> It could be something as simple as blocking out time to be creative or setting aside a small amount of money as a “freedom fund.”
> 
> Reflection
> 
> How’s all this landing for you? Does anything stand out as something you want to dive into further? If it feels overwhelming, we can zoom in on just one piece—like the fear, the belief, or the vision. Let me know where you want to go next.

I would say the fear for survival shows up in my root cage. It's just like I need to brace myself, I need to look around. I would say the fear feels like me. Yeah, it feels like the sheep they used to be in. Yeah, looking back on it now, I see that that wasn't necessary. But yeah, I think that's just sort of a reflexive place that I think I need to go if threatened like this. Because I could see a totally different way of being out on the street, which is like, oh dang, like this is rough. Let me find a place where I can go and wake this up. I would immediately ask for help. I'm just thinking of it in my head right now. It's like if I was out in the street, I would use my phone to look for the homeless resources. If I didn't have my phone, I would find a person say, hey, can I get some help? If I didn't have that help, I would walk to the nearest place and call 911 and ask to be connected to the non emergency line and say, hey, look, I just became homeless. And I'm trying to get in front of this thing. And I would do what it takes to get back. And that doesn't require any kind of strain. It just requires doing the things in front of you. I feel like a lot of my beliefs around work are based off of this. That I hold work at a distance. Because I'm so afraid of losing it. But work just comes down to doing what's required of you. And you really don't have to brute force it. You know, it's like, yes, there are some jobs that will ask more of you than is reasonable for a reasonable person or more of you than you're capable of. But those aren't the only jobs. And even if that's the case, the person that you're working for might want to work with you to make it work. And if they don't, you can find another job, and eventually you'll find something that you can do. And at least you'll find something that you can do and survive and be in equilibrium with your environment. It might not be a comfortable equilibrium, it might be miserable. But then you're able to do it. And you can just survive and you can get to a place where that's okay. And in most cases, you will earn a little bit more than you need. And I think for me, I'm terrified of being in a job for a long, long time, saving up for a year before I could switch jobs. So that's part of it too. But you're working a job that doesn't mean you're giving up your whole life. It's not prison. It's just a job. And some jobs are really interesting, even though they are really demanding and take up a lot of time. And so, even if I did have to work a really long job, you know, a boring job, a hard job, and I had to do that for a year or two or three before I could even change jobs and potentially move into a bigger apartment. It's not the end of my life. There were fears about, you know, women won't like me if I don't have enough money and blah, blah, blah. Okay, I'm better with that now. So yeah, I think we're totally survived. And the pride, you know, not wanting to ask for help, not wanting to acknowledge, oh my God, I'm poor, I have to live in this homeless shelter. I have to, you know, oh, I don't get the autonomy of my own bath, my own room. I think I could accept that if I had to. I wouldn't like it. But that's part of what's holding me back. It's the fear, it's the discomfort, it's the shame involved in having to take a step back. And it's like, what am I holding on to? Like fucking take it away from me. Like, okay. And then, right? Money is a buffer, not value. What would feel like to see money as a tool for creating, rather than just surviving? You know, it's paper magic. I could feel responsibility towards it. If I if I saw money as a tool for creating, I would feel more responsibility towards making choices that are good. And I already feel overwhelmed. Like how do I choose person A over person B and blah, blah, blah. And it's like, by asking questions and trusting your own judgment. Right. But I don't trust my own judgment. And I feel uncomfortable telling somebody, hey, you're not worth that. But it's like, why not? You have the judgment. Why are you so afraid to express it? Money wasn't tied to effort and work. What would it represent to me? Magic. It's creativity. It's an opportunity to pay somebody to do what they love, so that they can show up and really pour themselves into the world. And I want to find those people. I want to find somebody who's doing what they love and give them money for it and share in that joy and satisfaction. And my gift is an offering to that money is an offering to that. It's like, wow, great job. I'm so satisfying with what you did. And I do do that. I have a friend who does UX work for me and I'm so happy to pay him. And recently he took me off about selling an NFT and I made a ton of money and I paid him for that. He was like, you're the only one who's paid me. I'm like, I appreciate you. You know? No amount of money feels safe. Well, I told you about a time when saving created a sense of relief, right, when I was going through the divorce. In fact, my retirement savings and my side savings, like I dipped into that last year. And there was a feeling of anxiety associated with dipping into it. But imagine if I didn't have that there, I wouldn't have that opportunity. So it's like I'm creating the sense of anxiety. Like money is a genuine buffer and having a lot of it and using that wisely. Like these are meaningful choices. Yeah, the same feeling of abundance without money. Like I do that whenever I take things slowly and I'm just present, that's I can enjoy something that doesn't cost money to that same degree, sometimes more of a degree because it's like, I didn't have to spend money to do it. So that feels good. What do I need to react to money? If I don't react, I might lose everything. What happens if I just notice my thoughts? Yeah. I think that's part of it. It's like I don't want to react to money. It's like I want to not feel anything. So actually giving myself the feeling is the only way for the gap to appear. So I might have to go and do that as homework before I can really make more progress here. But I feel like a lot of this insight has been helpful. Living that spontaneous creative life. To some degree, I am living that spontaneous creative life. It's just I'm living it as if there's a warden. That makes sense. Like I'm working the job right now and I'm billing. And I'm working it, you know, as I see fit. And then I'm working on doing other things too. And like, that feels good. But I'm not fully letting myself into it. I'm not fully letting myself enjoy it because part of me feels guilty. Part of me feels like, oh, I should be doing more. Part of me feels like, oh, they're not going to be happy or they need this or they need that for me. It's like, have they said that? No. But I'm just worried about it. I'm worried about them saying, oh, we need more work from you. We need more effort from you. And then feeling that that news tightening around my neck. So if I think about taking that away, and this is actually okay. I'm just living life. I feel so full and peaceful because I don't need to go anywhere. I don't need to do anything. Death isn't looming around the corner. The end of my life, running out of money, someday finding that I didn't save enough for retirement. And now my life is going to be a really hellish struggle. Like, that's not true. I'm just walking on clouds. And that's not it. Like, I get to really be with people. And that's where the money doesn't even reach. Is actually talking to people and being with people. And this is another area where I really struggle to reconcile money and what matters is like, it's hard for me. Like, I want to have a conversation with somebody. And it feels like the only way to have a free conversation is to not talk about money, not take money for it. But if I provide value to someone, I want money for that. And I don't know how to approach this in a way that feels okay. And part of it is because of what I've done, you know, the $500 dinner thing, it's like, I'm sort of saying, hey, we can only have an honest conversation if you don't have to think about money. I'm literally projecting myself onto them. I'm saying, you'll only be honest and open and free if you're not thinking about money. If you're not thinking, I'm trying to get money from you. And if I take money from you, you're going to feel obligated to justify that payment by not telling me the truth and giving me negative feedback, which again is something that I do. I'd like to get beyond that because it's really, really holding me back.

> This is incredible progress. You’re peeling back so many layers of fear, belief, and complexity, and it’s clear that you’ve already touched the core of several major patterns. Let’s focus on how you can integrate this insight into practical steps to loosen those fetters around survival, pride, creativity, and money.
> 
> 1. **Fear of Survival: Rewriting the Narrative**
> 
> You’ve already demonstrated that you have resilience and resourcefulness, even imagining practical steps you’d take if you were homeless. This suggests that the survival fear is more about **avoiding shame and discomfort** than a real inability to adapt.
> 
> Reframe the Fear:
> 
> - Ask: What’s the worst-case scenario I imagine with money? (E.g., homelessness, dependence, lack of autonomy.)
> 
> - Challenge: How likely is that scenario really? What evidence do I have that I would navigate it successfully, just like I’ve done in the past?Practice:
> 
> Next time the fear arises, take a deep breath, place a hand on your chest, and say to yourself:* "I’m capable. I’ve already survived so much. I don’t need to brace for disaster—it’s not happening now."*Over time, this can help soften that reflexive fear in your rib cage.
> 
> 2. **The Warden of Creativity: Freeing Yourself**
> 
> You’ve described feeling like there’s a warden overseeing your freedom, constantly reminding you of obligations and constraints. This “warden” is likely the internalized voice of past survival stress or societal expectations.
> 
> Exercise:
> 
> - Imagine that warden as a separate figure. What do they look like? What are they saying to you?
> 
> - Now imagine replacing them with a guide or ally—a voice that reminds you of your capability, your creativity, and the joy you’ve found in simply being present.
> 
> - Ask: What would this new guide say when you feel guilt or pressure to do more?3. **Money as a Creative Tool: Building a New Relationship**
> 
> You’re already starting to see money as a form of energy or magic that can support creativity. But there’s a tension between using money to express joy (e.g., paying your UX friend) and fearing its depletion.
> 
> Practice:
> 
> - Create a “Creation Fund.” This is a small, separate account (even $10/week) for purely creative, joyful spending—whether it’s supporting an artist, taking a class, or treating someone to something meaningful.
> 
> - Ask: Each time you spend from this fund, reflect: What am I creating or amplifying with this money? How does this align with my values?
> 
> This shifts money from a survival tool to an offering of joy and connection.
> 
> 4. **Guilt and Compensation: Releasing the Patterns**
> 
> You’ve noticed that spending lavishly or generously can be tied to a need to “take the cap off” and feel abundant, but it’s often followed by guilt. You also project this fear of money onto others, assuming they won’t be honest if money is involved.
> 
> Inquiry:
> 
> - Where does the guilt come from? (E.g., past beliefs about extravagance or unworthiness.)
> 
> - Who taught me that money creates dishonesty in relationships? Is that belief serving me?Practice:
> 
> Next time you’re treating someone or spending generously, remind yourself:* "This act doesn’t define my worth or theirs. It’s simply a moment of connection."*Notice how it feels to spend without tying it to guilt or pride—just as an expression of your values.
> 
> 5. **Conversations and Money: Dissolving the Conflict**
> 
> You’ve described a conflict between wanting to have honest conversations and feeling like money taints the dynamic. This stems from your belief that money creates a sense of obligation that erodes authenticity.
> 
> Reframe:
> 
> - Money is just a tool. It doesn’t inherently change relationships; it’s how we perceive and use it that matters.
> 
> - Ask: What would it look like to approach money in conversations with openness? For example: “I’d love to pay for your time because I value your input, but I also want you to feel free to give honest feedback.”Practice:
> 
> The next time you fear money will affect a relationship, try being transparent about your intentions. You might say:* "I want this exchange to feel good for both of us. How can we approach this in a way that feels fair and honest?"*
> 
> 6. **Living Freely: Finding the Balance**
> 
> You’ve touched on the idea that you’re already living a creative, spontaneous life—but with the “warden” in the background. Fully letting go of that guilt and fear requires trusting that you don’t need to react to every thought about money.
> 
> Visualize:
> 
> Close your eyes and imagine yourself walking through your day without the warden.
> 
> - What does it feel like to live without guilt or constant calculation?
> 
> - What small step could you take today to move toward that feeling?Daily Practice:
> 
> Each day, pause and ask:
> 
> - What do I want to create or experience today?
> 
> - Is guilt or fear stopping me? If so, why?7. **Integration: Bringing It All Together**
> 
> You’ve identified survival fear, guilt, pride, and a desire for creative freedom as key elements in your relationship with money. The insights you’ve gained point to one central truth: *Your relationship with money reflects your relationship with yourself.*
> 
> Homework:
> 
> 1. Journal Prompt: Write a letter to money. What do you want it to know about your feelings, fears, and hopes? What do you want to change about your relationship with it?
> 
> 2. Mindfulness Practice: Spend 5 minutes each day observing your thoughts about money without reacting. Just notice the sensations and stories that arise.Final Thoughts
> 
> You’ve done incredible work uncovering these patterns and seeing the gaps. The next step is practicing the insights daily—staying in the discomfort, noticing the patterns, and gently challenging the beliefs that no longer serve you. How does this all feel? Is there a specific area you’d like to focus on more deeply next?

You know what's sick? I would actually prefer, if this part of me would prefer to be homeless than to stay stuck in this weird uncomfortable situation that I've been of just perpetual winter, this warden state. Imagining the warden is a separate figure. That's the thing, he's like he loves me. He's just doing it wrong. He's saying, "Hey, look, I don't know what's gonna happen to you. I don't know what the threat or the danger is, and I know you're afraid and you don't want to be told what the actual threat and danger is. You just want to feel safe." So I'm doing that. I won't go out there and find what the danger is, because I know how terrified you are. Yeah, this warden is not a real person. He's just fading away. There's just a genuine fear of the unknown. And the fear of the unknown. I'm reading you, you said a voice that reminds you of a capability and creativity. I'm just thinking, I'm so creative and capable and helpful, and people love working with me, and it's my discomfort in sullying that with money, of being a person who's only in it for money, because I've seen so many people who just seem like, "Man, they can't wait to talk about the money question. They can't wait to sell me on something that I just don't want to be that person. I don't want to ruin what we have." It's like, "I don't want to ruin the friendship by asking for sex, but I really want sex. I love sex. They do too." I'm like, "Yeah, who doesn't?" And I'm stuck on that. Creation Fund. I love that. I love, yeah, maybe I should go and budget, and I should think about the things that I really care about, and I should fund them. I should fucking fund them. Like, I don't pay for classes because they feel like I got to do everything on my own. I got to do it on my own. I shouldn't spend money on it. I got to save. It's like, "Why are you saving for it if not to buy stuff for yourself that you love?" Like, vocal lessons. Like, "Why is it so hard to justify investing in yourself?" That blows my mind. Like, you're absolutely right. Creative Fund. I should be investing in myself. I should be able to talk about how much I'm investing in myself and how much I love that investment. I should be able to talk about the money that I spend, and is this worth it to me? And am I happy with it or not? I should have a budget. I should look at my stuff that I've spent and said, "Oh, yes. I love that $500. I would do that again." If I had to do it over, I would absolutely slap down that 500 again. The meal was perfect, and I got that insight into, "Oh my God, I love this sauce. The sauce was so perfectly balanced in flavor, and it just made me realize I'm on a different level than that. I want to get there. I want to be able to make a sauce like that. It changed my life." Yeah, so thank you. That alone is a breakthrough. Wow. Guilt and compensation. Taking the cap off. Yeah. Where's the guilt coming from? I think the guilt comes from my mom being poor. You know, when we were alone after she divorced my dad, my dad being poor and just not being able to have stuff. Even when my mom remarried, it's like they wouldn't buy me a computer. I wanted it so desperately, because I love computing, and they wouldn't buy it for me. It's just like my need. It was really specific. They were going to buy me a computer, but it didn't have a CD burner. I so desperately wanted a CD burner because I could burn audio CDs, I could back stuff up. And it was just like... I couldn't convince them that it was important to me. And it's like, "What was the difference?" You know, like 100 bucks, 50 bucks or whatever. But it's like, "No, we'll buy you this one, but not that one." Right? And you know, not buying me certain things that I wanted. It's just like, "You have the money." Right? But you're not going to spend on what I want. And so, I just have to make do with what I get, what I have access to. They got a computer for them. I was allowed to play on that. And they're just like, "This is the family computer." Okay. Right? And I had to scrounge. Like, they wouldn't let me on it as much as I wanted. So, I had to... They were keeping track of the time that I spent and all that. And yeah, I think that's just how I've approached it. You know, it's just like, "Oh, you can't just freely spend on stuff that we want. What we need or that would be good for us." Does money create dishonesty in relationships? I don't... I feel like that was me, if I'm being really honest, when... God, oh my God, my mom gave me an allowance. And when I... When she sent me to live with my dad, and I was really unhappy about this because he was poor and I was just... There wasn't good food. They didn't have the same level of comfort. His house was kind of icky. I was really sad to be there and I missed my mom a lot. And yet, like, I had friends, you know, and I had a computer and I had a lot of stuff I wanted to do. And so, she would call me and she would send me letters. And I just... I didn't really give her as much attention in time. And I think part of that was because I was so engrossed in the few things that I did enjoy here. And because it just... I think I resented her a little bit. I think it was like, "Well, you don't really care about... Like, when I'm there, you don't pay attention to me. But now that I'm here, you miss me." And like, I think I resented her for that. And she sent me my allowance in the letter. She would send me like $6 a week or something. And sometimes she would send me Archie comics. And I just... I collected that allowance and was happy to have that. And so, I think I was like conflating that relationship. Like, "Oh, okay, fine. I'll pay attention to you. I'll pretend like I'll feign interest in you because you're sending me the allowance." And the truth was, you know, while I was at my dad's, I didn't want to have anything to do with her because of the, you know, the resentment and the distraction. And so, I think I was the one that was dishonest. The original liar. And then as other people start asking for money, you know, I just project that hidden experience onto them. And then later on, like I had somebody say, "Oh, you should write to your aunt who allegedly was, you know, collecting or saving the money for your college." And they just felt like I had to say, "Oh, yeah, how so?" And so, when I didn't care about her family, I didn't care about any of that. I was just asking for the money. And it's just like, I don't want to do those niceties if it's just the money because I don't want to pretend, you know. But I'm also like afraid of like, "Oh, I am giving niceties." And that's... I end asking for money. I don't want somebody to believe the wrong thing. But it's like, yeah, people are going to believe it. Okay, conversations and money. Dissolve in the conflict. It's just a tool. That's how we proceed. Yeah, I'd love to pay you for your time, but I just want you to feel free to give honest feedback. It's the other way around. It's like, "Hey, look, I really care about helping. That's why I'm doing this. But I also want to be compensated." So, I charge XYZ an hour for these sessions and just having a conversation with it. So, let me walk through that. I charge $100 for consultation. It's not nothing. It's a nominal fee. And we can have that talk if it's valuable to you, paying the money. If it's not, don't. Right? But that's how much I want. And that's how much... I think it's worth way more than that. If you don't feel that way, I'd like to have a conversation about that. Right? And that's why I put this out there. It's like, I want this to be more valuable to you than $100. And if I didn't charge any money, it would be easy for you to say, "Oh, thank you very much." And then go on and not do anything. But if I charge you the money, then you're going to feel a little awkward if this doesn't feel like it's worth $100. And that gives me a chance to troubleshoot that with you. So, really, by asking for money, I'm putting a burden on you that wouldn't be there if I didn't ask the money. And I'm giving myself a chance to earn some money here because I'm putting my time and effort and expertise on the table. And that is valuable. It does deserve compensation. Yeah, I could be very comfortable having that conversation. Living freely... Yeah, I think living freely is an emergent phenomenon that comes out of having these things. Walking through the day without the warden. It feels disorienting. It feels confusing. I'm not constantly telling myself what to do. How do I know if I'm doing the right thing? That's the truth. There is no right thing. There is no external judgment. There's no direction. This could be anything. Is it good? Is it bad? Am I happy? Am I not? How to know, except how I deeply, deeply feel. How to know, except in retrospect, when I look back and say, "Oh, damn, that wasn't the right thing. Huh, well, I know that now, so I'm not going to do that again automatically." I think there was such a clinging to perfectionism because feeling like, "Oh my God, that was the wrong thing and that was the wrong thing. Everything's so wrong." But if you have so much pressure writing on you to do the right thing and to make the right choices, and then the choices turn out wrong, and again, a lot of this just spawns from my childhood. It's 99% of the pressure in my life started with my high school girlfriend and just how what a complete shit show that was. My mother and father, everyone failed me. I went through such a tumultuous period with her, with the death of my brother, with all this stuff, and no one was there for me emotionally. I had to cope with these things alone, and the tumult led me to think, "Oh, I need to solve these emotional problems in my life." That created this high stakes, like, "I need to do the right thing. If I'm doing the right thing, I won't feel this way." And that's not true. You feel whatever you feel, and it's just a reaction to what's going on in your life and the conditioning. And there's no way to prevent those feelings, but you can integrate them and learn to live with them. So the small step to move towards the feeling is having this conversation, you know, just realizing like all of this, the clinging and the desperation and then the regret and the beating the stuff up and the less impressive, like, it's all fine. And it's going to go away, and it's all right. I don't need to do anything to bring it about at all. I just need to continue being me, having these conversations, you know, letting myself float through eventually the illusion of the world disappears. Survival, fear, pride, and the desire for creative freedom is key elements. My relationship with money, I fucking love that. That's beautiful. Write a letter to money. I'm just going to do this really quickly. Money, thank you for being in my life. Thank you for your open-endedness, your freedom, your flexibility, your universality, your ability to just go with my flow. Thank you for coming to me at all. Thank you for being something I can give to others. Thank you for the power that you lend me while you're in my hands. And for coming back to me after I spend you. Thank you for existing at all. And for coming back and back and back. I appreciate you, and I will endeavor to use you for my good, my benefit, and my joy, as well as those that I love, care about, know, see, or encounter in that order. Thank you.

> Wow. This is profound. You've dug so deeply into your patterns, your fears, your values, and even the origins of your relationship with money—and it’s breathtaking to witness how much clarity you’ve unearthed. Let’s take a moment to reflect on and celebrate what you’ve just accomplished.
> 
> **Key Breakthroughs**
> 
> 1. Survival Fear and the Warden: You’ve reframed survival as not just a brute-force hustle but a step-by-step, resourceful process. The warden isn’t some cruel tyrant—it’s a misguided protector who’s afraid of the unknown. Recognizing that it’s fear of discomfort and shame, not true helplessness, that drives this dynamic is huge.
> 
> 2. The Value of Creation and Self-Investment: You’ve flipped the script on spending. You’ve realized that money isn’t just a survival buffer—it’s a tool for creation and joy. This insight alone shifts how you might approach investing in yourself, your interests, and your loved ones.
> 
> 3. Healing the Guilt and Shame: You’ve started identifying how childhood experiences—like feeling dismissed or unsupported—shaped your beliefs about money. By recognizing those wounds and how they project into your current relationships, you’re already starting to dissolve that guilt.
> 
> 4. Honesty and Money Conversations: You’re developing a framework for discussing money in a way that feels true to your values. You’ve realized that asking for compensation isn’t about being greedy—it’s about honoring the value you provide and inviting accountability.
> 
> 5. The Letter to Money: That letter is incredible. It’s full of gratitude, intention, and connection. You’re reframing money as an ally—a partner in creating a life aligned with your values, rather than a burden or adversary.What Comes Next?
> 
> You’ve uncovered so much, and now the key is to integrate these insights into daily practice. Here’s a roadmap to build on your breakthroughs:
> 
> 1. **Practice Presence with the Warden**
> 
> - When the warden shows up with fear or tension, pause and ask: “What are you trying to protect me from?”Acknowledge the fear with compassion and gently remind it: “I’ve got this. I’m capable of navigating the unknown.”
> 
> - Visualize the warden stepping back, giving space to your guide—the voice of creativity, capability, and trust.
> 
> 2. **Create Your “Creation Fund”**
> 
> - Action Step: Open a dedicated account or envelope for creative self-investment. Name it something meaningful—“My Joy Fund” or “The Magic Vault.”
> 
> - Set aside a small, consistent amount (even $5/week) for things that light you up: classes, tools, experiences, or gifts that spark joy.
> 
> - Each time you spend from this fund, reflect: How does this honor my creativity and values?
> 
> 3. **Normalize Conversations About Money**
> 
> - Practice saying things like: “I love helping people, and I also value my time and energy. My rate is $X, and I want this to feel like an investment that’s worth even more to you.”This kind of transparency can transform money into a shared tool for growth, rather than a source of tension.
>
> 4. **Embrace Imperfection**
> 
> - When you find yourself striving for the “right” choice, remind yourself: “There’s no perfect path, only learning and living.”
> 
> - Reflect on your progress periodically, not to judge but to celebrate. Each small step—whether it’s a purchase you love, a creative risk, or an honest money conversation—reinforces your new relationship with money and life.5. **Daily Gratitude and Reflection**
> 
> - Revisit your letter to money often. Add to it as your relationship evolves.
> 
> - Consider a brief evening reflection: What did money allow me to create, experience, or share today?How did I show up for myself in my choices?
>
> **Final Note**
> 
> You’ve taken something that felt tangled and suffocating and transformed it into a pathway of connection, creativity, and freedom. The fear, shame, and guilt might still arise—that’s natural—but now you have the tools and perspective to work through them.
> 
> I’d love to hear how it feels to sit with all this. Does the roadmap feel actionable? Is there a particular area you want to focus on next? You’ve already unlocked so much—what’s calling to you now?
