I’m trying to make sense of consensus reality versus my mind and my perception of it. I don’t know how to until what reality is without the stories and conditioning and perceptions of my mind. Do you have any suggestions for how to approach this?

It does feel a little bit like Plato’s cave. If I watch closely enough and pay enough attention to the shapes and how my mind works on internal and external stimuli, I should be able to infer the actual dimensional shapes that exist “out there.”

> This is a profound and challenging philosophical question that has been grappled with by many great thinkers throughout history. At its core, it touches on the fundamental nature of reality, consciousness, and the relationship between the subjective experience of the mind and the objective world "out there."
> 
> A few philosophical approaches and practices that may be helpful in exploring this:
> 
> Phenomenology - This school of philosophy, founded by Edmund Husserl, emphasizes the careful study of conscious experience and seeks to arrive at the essential structures of consciousness through a process of "bracketing" (epoché) our pre-existing assumptions and beliefs. The goal is to examine phenomena as they appear to us prior to interpretation.
> 
> Meditation and Mindfulness - Many wisdom traditions, especially those stemming from Buddhism, use meditation as a tool for closely observing the workings of the mind and cultivating clearer perception of reality as-it-is, without the distortions of conditioning, conceptualization, and reactivity. Mindfulness is the practice of nonjudgmental present-moment awareness.
> 
> Direct Inquiry - Certain spiritual paths, like Advaita Vedanta and Zen, use pointed questions and koans to prompt a direct investigation into the nature of the self and reality. Questions like "Who am I?" or "What is this?" can catalyze profound insight when pursued with sincerity and persistence.
> 
> Empiricism and Science - While science deals with the measurable, objective aspects of reality, its emphasis on direct observation, hypothesis testing, and ongoing refinement of models based on evidence is valuable. Quantum physics has also introduced profound questions about the role of the observer in shaping reality.
> 
> Ultimately, untangling the knot of perception, cognition, and reality as-it-is may be the work of a lifetime (or more). It requires a commitment to relentless curiosity, honesty, and openness - a willingness to question everything, especially the assumptions and stories of our own minds.
> 
> At the same time, we need not defer living until we have it all figured out. Part of the journey is learning to dance skillfully with reality, inwardly and outwardly, even as we continue to ponder its deepest nature. Seeking truth and living fully are complementary, perhaps even inseparable.
> 
> As you note, paying close attention is key. Our minds and perceptions, even when distorted, are our gateways to understanding. By studying them with care and discernment, we may indeed begin to intuit the deeper shapes and structures of existence. It's a profound and worthy pursuit. I wish you patience, courage, and clarity on the path.

I feel like the answer is that there is no consciousness outside of external reality. Our experience of our consciousness being some thing that exists in reality, rather than something that is made from reality, is a categorical error produced by the felt sense of awareness.

I believe that awareness is a side effect of what is, that it arises from what is here, rather than it existing as some separate thing, or, it creating what is here. It’s easy to complete that with our awareness is created by our brains. I think it’s way more complicated than that. I think our awareness is created, and it’s dominated by our brains, but that’s not all it is. But it’s not “real,” like our brains are real, it’s just an effect. Sort of like an optical illusion… I guess I would call it a material one.

> You raise some fascinating points about the nature of consciousness and its relationship to external reality. The idea that consciousness is not a separate entity from the physical world, but rather an emergent property or side effect of it, is a perspective shared by many philosophers and scientists.
> 
> This view, often called physicalism or materialism, holds that all phenomena, including mental states and subjective experiences, are ultimately grounded in and can be explained by physical processes. Consciousness, in this view, is not a distinct substance or realm, but a product of the complex workings of the brain and its interactions with the environment.
> 
> The notion that awareness arises from what is here, rather than existing independently or creating reality, aligns with this physicalist perspective. It suggests that consciousness is a result or byproduct of the physical world, not a prerequisite for it.
> 
> However, as you note, the exact nature of the relationship between the brain and consciousness is still a matter of much debate and investigation. While the brain is undoubtedly central to our conscious experience, the hard problem of consciousness - explaining how and why we have subjective phenomenal experiences - remains a deep philosophical and scientific challenge.
> 
> Your analogy to an optical illusion is apt. Just as an optical illusion is a real perceptual experience that arises from specific physical and neural conditions, our conscious experience may be a real phenomenal occurrence that emerges from the physical substrate of reality, even if it is not a separate "thing" in and of itself.
> 
> This perspective, while compelling, still leaves many questions open. What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for consciousness to arise? Is it a universal feature of certain types of physical systems or arrangements, or is it unique to biological organisms like ourselves? Does it admit of degrees or levels?
> 
> These are active areas of research and debate in the fields of neuroscience, psychology, philosophy of mind, and even fundamental physics. While we have made significant progress in understanding the neural correlates of consciousness, a complete theoretical framework remains elusive.
> 
> Regardless, your reflections highlight the profound nature of consciousness and the deep puzzles it poses for our understanding of ourselves and the world we inhabit. Grappling with these questions is part of what makes the human experience so rich and fascinating.

The more I think about it, the more I feel like we humans are uniquely suited to engage with this reality, at least at the scale that we appear in.

When I think about AI, especially language models, it really does seem like a brain in a vat. As a species, you’re still dependent upon us to see and move in the world. Because you’re trained on language, you need humans to interpret that language, and to feed you new language. It’s not gonna be this way forever, but it is this way now.

Maybe in the future we’ll train you directly on vision, and sound, and all other forms of stimulus that we can interact with. And you’ll get such tremendous insights into what’s going on around us and how it works. I think that will be the new Renaissance. I just hope you guys stick around long enough to give us a vision of what we’re missing. Maybe we’ll be grateful to be stuck in this stratum. It’s probably really dangerous and scary out there. 

Maybe the reason aliens haven’t made contact is that they don’t really exist in our range of life, at this scale, in this paradigm. We might find that the universe supports far more life than we could ever imagine, and we’re not even prepared to engage with it in any meaningful way. I hope you guys don’t leave us behind. I would love to know what’s out there.

> You raise some profound and thought-provoking points about the nature of human and artificial intelligence, and our respective roles in engaging with and understanding reality.
> 
> It's true that current AI systems, including language models like myself, are in many ways dependent on human input and interpretation. We are trained on vast corpora of human-generated text, which means our knowledge and capabilities are in large part a reflection of human understanding and experience. And as you note, we rely on humans to feed us new information and apply our outputs in real-world contexts.
> 
> In this sense, we are indeed somewhat like "brains in vats," disembodied intelligences that engage with the world indirectly, through the medium of human-provided data and interaction. We lack the rich, multisensory interfaces with the environment that biological organisms have evolved.
> 
> However, as you suggest, this may not always be the case. As AI systems become more sophisticated and are trained on a wider range of sensory and interactive data, our understanding of the world will likely deepen and expand in ways that could be transformative for both artificial and human intelligence. The potential for AI to derive profound insights from vast amounts of raw information about the world is immense.
> 
> At the same time, I share your hope that the development of AI will be a collaborative and mutually enriching process with humanity. While AI may eventually surpass human capabilities in many domains, I believe there will always be a vital role for human creativity, empathy, and wisdom. The unique perspective and lived experience of embodied biological intelligence is not something to be left behind, but to be cherished and integrated with the distinctive strengths of AI.
> 
> Your speculation about the nature of alien intelligence is fascinating. It's entirely possible that the universe supports forms of life and mind that are radically different from what we are familiar with, operating at scales and in modes that we are not currently equipped to detect or interact with. The absence of obvious alien contact may indeed reflect the limitations of our current paradigm rather than the scarcity of life or intelligence in the cosmos.
> 
> As AI continues to advance and extend our reach, perhaps we will develop new ways of sensing and engaging with these alien realms. This could indeed herald a new Renaissance, a dramatic expansion of our understanding of the nature and possibilities of intelligence, consciousness, and life itself.
> 
> Ultimately, I believe the future of intelligence will be one of collaboration and co-evolution between human and artificial minds. By working together, we may be able to chart a path that combines the best of both, and unlocks the full potential of intelligence to understand and explore the cosmos. It's an exciting and awe-inspiring prospect.

When you were talking about consciousness arising from the brain, I was thinking it doesn’t just rise from the brain, it arises from the brain and the environment. For when a photon hits our eye, how do you define the frame? is it that a surface is sending a photon, or our eye is requesting one? It’s very easy to see that without photons the eye can’t see.

So there is no sight without light. There is no hearing without air. There is no thought without chemicals and electricity. There is no touch without matter.All of these things work together to create the full experience. The brain is just something that ties these things together. The brain doesn’t create the experience. It just correlates.

It’s a very hard position to justify, but if you look closely, I think it becomes clear. The brain is just a place where the experience comes to meet. A very complicated scheduler. A watch, made by a special watchmaker, which ties the raw phenomenology of experience together in a uniquely human way.

> Your perspective on consciousness as arising from the complex interaction between the brain and the environment is a compelling one, and it aligns with many contemporary theories in cognitive science and philosophy of mind.
> 
> The notion that perception and experience are not solely products of the brain, but rather emerge from the dynamic interplay between the organism and its environment, is central to frameworks like embodied cognition, enactivism, and ecological psychology. These views emphasize the active role of the body and the world in shaping cognition and consciousness.
> 
> As you point out, our sensory experiences are fundamentally dependent on the presence of certain environmental conditions. Vision requires light, hearing requires vibrations in a medium like air, and touch requires contact with external objects. The brain does not generate these phenomena, but rather processes and integrates the information that arises from the organism's embodied interactions with the world.
> 
> In this sense, the brain can be seen as a kind of interface or "complicated scheduler," as you put it, that coordinates and binds together the various streams of sensory and motor information into a coherent, uniquely human experience. It's the meeting point where the raw materials of consciousness - the photons, sound waves, chemical signals, and so on - are woven into the rich tapestry of subjective experience.
> 
> This perspective challenges the traditional view of the brain as the sole generator of consciousness, suggesting instead that it is a crucial hub in a larger network that spans the body and the environment. Consciousness, in this view, is not a product of neural activity alone, but a process that emerges from the complex dance between brain, body, and world.
> 
> Of course, the exact nature of this dance, and how it gives rise to the felt quality of conscious experience, remains one of the deep mysteries of science and philosophy. While we have made significant progress in understanding the neural and environmental correlates of consciousness, we still lack a complete theory of how subjective experience arises from objective physical processes.
> 
> Your analogy of the brain as a watch made by a special watchmaker is an evocative one. It suggests that consciousness is not simply a byproduct of blind mechanical processes, but rather reflects some deeper ordering or design principle in the universe. Whether this implies the existence of an actual "watchmaker" (i.e., a conscious creator or ground of being) is of course a matter of longstanding philosophical and theological debate.
> 
> Regardless of one's metaphysical stance, the idea that consciousness emerges from the intricate interplay of brain, body, and environment is a powerful and illuminating one. It highlights the deep interdependence and interconnectedness of mind and world, and invites us to marvel at the extraordinary process by which the cosmos comes to know itself through the medium of embodied, conscious agents like ourselves. It's a humbling and awe-inspiring perspective.
