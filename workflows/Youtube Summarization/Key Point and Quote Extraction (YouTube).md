## Here's the workflow

1. Open transcript on [a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8QVb63mlvA) (Click **Show Transcript** at bottom of description)

2. Click and drag to select the whole transcript, and copy with Ctrl+C or Cmd+C
   ![[../../../assets/youtube_summary_transcript.png]]

   3. Paste into your favorite LLM with a prompt like:

```
Can you summarize the key points from this video in a really concise list?
- 2-3 word "topic"
- .5 - 1 sentence explanation
- A shortened/cleaned quote from the video that substantiates it with context/detail?
- And add links and timestamps at the end of each

For the links and timestamps, you can infer the timestamp from the timestamps in the transcriptâ€”pick a time that is near a key quote.

Here is an example URL (this is the video):
[https://youtu.be/k8QVb63mlvA?t=1](https://youtu.be/k8QVb63mlvA?t=1)

"t" refers to seconds, so you might have to do a conversion.
 
The link should be with the minute+second timestamp, like so:

- **Dealing with judgment via Self-reflection**: Stop judging others to become less susceptible to judgment yourself. "When you stop judging everybody you become capable of dealing with judgment" [1:04]([https://youtu.be/k8QVb63mlvA?t=123](https://youtu.be/k8QVb63mlvA?t=123))

(That's just an example; I don't think that timestamp is correct for that quote.)
```
